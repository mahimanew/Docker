# Ephemeral storage and its drawbacks

### There are two types of volume

- Ephemeral
- Permenant

#### Ephemeral

```
docker run -d --name boxone lovelearnlinux/webserver:v1
docker ps
docker exec -it boxone /bin/bash

mkdir mydata
cd mydata
touch myfile
exit



cd /var/lib/docker/overlay2
ls
ls -lrt
cd ab44e44e39f4fdf7f5b6f39177f0afe598d375bdc96c40730b27ea5ae8b99cf0
ls
cd diff
ls
cd mydata
ls
```

- you can see the file which you have created inside the container

- let us stop and delete the container, then check the file

```
 cd
docker ps -a
docker stop boxone
docker rm boxone
cd /var/lib/docker/overlay2
ls -lrt
```
- since container has been deleted we can't get the diff file, and files also lost
