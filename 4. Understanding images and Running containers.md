# Understanding images and Running containers

### what is  docker image?

- A Docker image is a lightweight, standalone, executable package that includes everything needed to run a piece of software.
- and it contains the code, runtime, libraries, environment variables, and configuration files. 
- Docker images are the building blocks of Docker containers, they are used to create container instances.


### What is container?

- Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment.

docker images
```

```
# pull the docker image from docker hub
docker pull nginx
docker images
```
```
# inspect the image
docker inspect nginx 
```

```
# pull image from redhat registary
docker pull registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/httpd-24:1-321.1716477798
docker images
docker inspect e784f4560448
```

```
# create & run container in the detached mode
docker run -d nginx:latest
```

```
# list the running container
docker ps
# get the IP using below command and run the curl command to print the index.html content
docker inspect happy_davinci
curl 172.17.0.2

# create and run container for using another image
docker run -d registry.access.redhat.com/ubi9/httpd-24:1-321.1716477798
docker ps

# stop the container
docker stop pensive_hopper
docker ps # will not display because container has stopped 

# display all container (stoped and run conatiners)
docker ps -a

# start the container
docker start pensive_hopper
docker ps
docker stop pensive_hopper
docker stop nginx
docker stop happy_davinci
```

```
docker images

# delete images
docker rmi eaff3de76375 e784f4560448
docker ps
docker ps -a

# delete containers
docker rm 96fdbb1261d1 a82279770e9a
```

```
# Docker image and container store location
cd /var/lib/docker/image/overlay2/layers/layerdb/sha256
