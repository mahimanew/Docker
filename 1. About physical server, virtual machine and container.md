# About physical server, virtual machine and container

### What is physical server?

- A physical server is a hardware unit that stores, retrieves, and shares data with other computers on a network. They are also known as dedicated servers. Physical servers are typically located in a server room or data center and can run on operating systems like Windows or Linux.


### what is virtual machine?

- A virtual machine (VM) is a software-based version of a computer that can run programs and applications like a physical computer.
-  VMs are also known as "guest" computers and run on a physical machine.
-  It  provides computing resources through a hypervisor.

### what is container?

- Containers are packages of software that contain all of the necessary elements to run in any environment.

### difference between Physical server, virtual machine and container

- Hardware Utilization: Physical servers dedicate hardware to one OS. VMs share hardware via a hypervisor. Containers share the host OS kernel and are more lightweight.
- Isolation: Physical servers offer full isolation. VMs have good isolation with separate OS instances. Containers offer process-level isolation within the same OS.
- Resource Efficiency: Physical servers are the least efficient. VMs are more efficient. Containers are the most efficient.
- Setup and Scalability: Physical servers are time-consuming to set up and scale. VMs are easier and faster. Containers are the quickest and most flexible.
- Cost: Physical servers are the most expensive. VMs reduce costs by sharing resources. Containers offer the most cost savings due to lightweight resource usage.
