# About Monolithic Architecture, Microservices and cloud native applications

### Monolithic Architecture

- Single Deployable Unit: The entire application is deployed as one single unit.
- Tight Coupling: Components are tightly interwoven, leading to dependencies between them.
- Scalability: Typically, it scales by cloning the entire application on multiple servers, which can be resource-inefficient.
- Development: Easier to develop and test initially, but becomes complex as the codebase grows.
- Changes: A change in one part of the application often requires redeploying the whole application.

### Microservices Architecture

- Independence: Each microservice can be developed, deployed, and scaled independently.
- Loose Coupling: Services are loosely coupled, which enhances flexibility and resilience.
- Scalability: Individual services can be scaled independently based on demand.
- Development: Allows for more granular and parallel development, enabling different teams to work on different services.
- Changes: Changes to a service can be made and deployed without affecting the entire system.

### Cloud-Native Applications

- Cloud-native applications are designed specifically to run in the cloud, taking full advantage of cloud computing models. They are built using cloud services and are typically composed of microservices.

- Designed for the Cloud: Leverage cloud services such as storage, databases, and messaging to build and run applications.
- Containerization: Often use containers (e.g., Docker) for consistent deployment across environments.
- Dynamic Management: Use orchestration tools (e.g., Kubernetes) to manage and scale services dynamically.
- Resilience: Built to handle failures gracefully, often through redundancy and distributed systems practices.
- DevOps Practices: Emphasize continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD), automation, and monitoring.
