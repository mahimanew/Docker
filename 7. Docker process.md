# Docker process

 - Process id (PID) will generate for each container

 ### Move to interaction mode to check the process status with in the container

 ```
 docker exec -it webserver /bin/bash
 ps -ef
```
 - There are two processes running, one for container another for /bin/bash
 - if you kill the process 1 you will be terminated from bash, because each container has only one process id

### Practice 1
- Let us create new container and check the process state

```
docker run -it --name testone lovelearnlinux/webserver:v1 /bin/bash
ps -ef
```
- Now, only one process is running for bin bash

```
# exit and rm the testone container
exit
docker stop testone
docker rm testone
```

### Practice 2

- Let us create new container and check the process state without exit

```
docker run -it --name testone lovelearnlinux/webserver:v1 /bin/bash
ps -ef
```
 - in this stage only one process is running, now you can leave from bash using ctrl p ctrl q (without exit)
 - open another dupilicate terminal and check the status there, 2 process are running.

```
docker stop testone
docker rm testone
```

### Practice 3

```
docker run -it --name testone lovelearnlinux/webserver:v1 sleep 30
# open another dupilicate terminal and check the status using ps command
docker ps
```
- after 30 seconds container will be stopped
